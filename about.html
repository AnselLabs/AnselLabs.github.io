        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>
            I’m an <strong>electrical engineer</strong> who has been tinkering with wires, circuits, and computers for as long as I can remember.  
            Somewhere along the way, I fell deep into the world of <strong>Linux</strong> — hopping between Debian, Arch, and whatever else 
            catches my eye — while building a small homelab for servers, media, and experiments that occasionally even work.  
            I’ve also done freelance consulting and co-authored a research paper where our team worked with potassium ion pumps 
            to accelerate wound cell regeneration.
        </p>

        <h2>The Artist Side</h2>
        <p>
            But it’s not all wires and code. I’ve been an <strong>artist</strong> for as long as I can hold a pencil. Drawing, painting, 
            digital sketches, mixed media — it’s always been a constant thread in my life. My sketchbooks matter to me just as much 
            as my toolkits and terminals.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of engineering and art, I tinker with coding projects, dabble in game development, write the occasional poem, 
            and set up new self-hosted services just to see if I can make them run. This site is where all of those things — 
            the technical and the creative — get to live side by side.
        </p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
            This isn’t just a portfolio. It’s more of a <em>living lab</em> where I post new projects, artwork, and ideas as they 
            take shape. Some things might be polished, others might be half-broken experiments, but that’s part of the fun.  
        </p>

        <p><em>Thanks for stopping by — and welcome to Ansel.Labs.</em></p>
